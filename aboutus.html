							<p  class="text-body">Coffee Co. Originated in Seattle Washington in 2002. We are a new business, but in the past 16 years we have grown dramatically. Now we have more than 50 locations spread across the United States, and more than 200 farms worldwide where we grow our fresh grown coffee beans. It all started in 2001 where Chase, Malik, and Luke came up with the idea of Coffee Co. They had such a passion for coffee that they wanted to turn it into a career. So, they started in 2001 when they were all 18, selling homemade coffee at a stand in their neighborhood. Their costumers thought it was so good and more and more people heard about these three boys and their coffee. Then the three of them decided to take out a loan and build their own coffee shop in the city of Seattle. The shop was done in 2002 and they came up with the name Coffee Co. They had a hard time at first because it was hard to find customers and advertising. Once they started to get the word out through the city they finally paid off the loan and started making profit. Once the whole city was aware of their coffee and how good it was, everyone wanted to try Coffee Coâ€™s coffee. So they decided to take their profits and expand their business. Ever since, the business has been continuing to grow and expand and now has more than 50 stores spread across the state and they plan on having 100 by 2025. And later they are going to look into going worldwide and see if they can expand even more.
